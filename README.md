# recorder-embed
An embeddable web recorder primarily intended for Qualtrics integration. The code that's directly usable in Qualtrics can be found in the `qualtrics` folder. 

Created by Cynthia Zhong in June 2021 for a production experiment on Mandarin tone sandhi in Mandarin-English code-switching. You can find a demo of this recorder integrated into Qualtrics [here](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/SV_cAUchfAJtvpnfJI?Q_CHL=preview&Q_SurveyVersionID=current).

Based on [this tutorial by Pipe](https://blog.addpipe.com/using-recorder-js-to-capture-wav-audio-in-your-html5-web-site/) and uses [Recorder.js by Matt Diamond](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs).
